Company name has decided to open its resources to the public. By sharing its APIs, Company name can help accelerate the pace of collaboration and innovation of other companies and partners, by providing them with ready-to-be used APIs and Microservices. This API management platform becomes an API “portal” where developers across the B2B/B2C space can efficiently leverage Company name APIs.
The company has decided to open its APIs to the public because many emerging opportunities are coming from our world shaped by data and collaboration. 
Among the emerging opportunities, the most groundbreaking is that other companies can get access to Company name Microservices through the APIs, and leverage the ready to be used services to scale and innovate their business. This strategy would speed up other companies innovation, by allowing them to focus on their business, while exploiting other companies' best services.

Moreover, with this platform, other companies can have access to Company name’s data and become a partner of the company. Some example of data that partners might be interested to for their business are:

- **Dishes**: this collection of data is made of all dishes available on the menu and that are potentially included in - the Company name’s order 
- **Ingredients**: this collection includes all the ingredients that can be part of the dishes 
- **Provinces**: this collection includes all the provinces that are served by the company’s production location

Why should you use this platform? Let’s do an example.
The business of company X is focused on operating a website and mobile app for comparing restaurants based on users’ preferences. For example vegan users can visualise all physical and online restaurants that prepare at least some vegan dishes. Hence, Company X, whose business is focused on gathering and comparing data from other Company name companies and restaurants, is interested in having access to the menu, dishes and the geographic coverage in Italy of Company name. 
The company will have the possibility to access this information by jumping on this portal, getting access to the APIs, and using them to collect all the data it needs. 
Another example is Company Y, whose business consists in an online app focused on making easy reservations to restaurants based on daily offers. This company might want to get access to the APIs to create new reservations for its users. Other possible uses are the exploitation of the cancellation service already created by Company name and that other companies can exploit for the same purpose but for their business.
