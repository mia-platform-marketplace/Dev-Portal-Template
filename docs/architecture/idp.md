In a Digital Integration Hub, an **identity provider** is a system that offers user authentication as a service, manages
identity information, and provides authentication services to which applications can rely on. On top of that, an 
identity provider also manages identities roles and traces their activities.

There are a lot of standards for authorization protocols. Notable ones are:
* [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/),
* SAML,
* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/).
