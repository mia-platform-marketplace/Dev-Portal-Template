## Governance: the challenge of governing an enterprise Digital Integration Hub 

In the construction and incremental development of enterprise IT platforms, especially in enterprise contexts, a change 
in approach is becoming increasingly evident today, with a strong impact on business strategies and IT Governance. The 
new paradigm is well summarized by the claim "from projects to products": today the focus is on the development of 
digital products, which, like bricks in a puzzle, incrementally compose a digital platform, the real strategic asset of
the company.

This paradigm is in contrast to the classic approach of project-based development, in which each new project is 
approached as a separate site, unrelated to all the others, which will follow its own rules, methodologies, practices 
and development standards.

It's a change of perspective - starting to consider each new development as the realization of a real company product - 
which entails drastic consequences on governance models, on the ways in which support is given to decision-making 
processes as well as on the work of people in different roles. A change that requires more cross-area collaboration 
between teams and closer relationships between IT and the business.

|   	| Project  	| Product   	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| **Funding**	| Annual | Continuous, with more frequent (e.g. every 3 months) checkpoints on shifts in funding and resources |
| **Timeline** | Discrete with formal start and end dates | Continuous, assumed to be ongoing; no firm end dates, although product can be retired |
| **Teaming**  	| Matrixed - orchestration across departmental and technical domains, but with functional teams owning the resources | Multiscriplinary - much of the team working full time on the product, breaking down the silos of functional specialization |
| **Metrics** | On time/budget, although IT organizations that are more mature may measure projects based on business outcomes | Customer satisfaction, profit, market share (business-centric metrics) |

### AaaP (API as a Product) and IT Governance

The centrality of APIs, which are increasingly becoming a real business product (AaaP), implies that IT should no longer
be considered only as a cost center but as a center of value production, delivered through concrete business products 
(and services). From a technological point of view, therefore, companies need to create a digital platform that allows 
them to properly organize and manage their offerings and IT assets. 

### Governance IT trough Internal Developer Portal e API Gateway

The first fundamental component of this platform is the **Internal Developer Portal**: this tool allows you to promote your APIs on the market. In addition to containing documentation updated in real-time according to the OpenAPI specification, it allows external developers and partners to view, test and use the available APIs.

In addition, it provides the business with complete visibility into the catalog of available products and allows you to monitor the flow of API consultation and usage.

Another key component is the API Gateway, which allows you to centralize access control and ensure API security. A solid and reliable Gateway, in fact, constitutes a single access point to the system, from which to manage all API calls
and requests, configuring authentication rules, call quotas and limits, and data request management modes. This component, coupled with a set of API security best practices, is an essential piece of governance for securely managing complex ecosystems. Even micro-gateways are rapidly being used to separate and manage communication between blocks of different services and APIs within the same ecosystem.

Bringing multiple functions together in a single platform is strategic, as it remains difficult to use dozens of tools (Git, Jenkins, Docker, Nexus, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Kibana, to name a few) to manage different phases in the code lifecycle.

However, building an enterprise-grade digital platform is not a task that is limited to setting up an IT technology platform, but includes support to get people from different teams working together in the best possible way.

A digital platform improves internal communication between development and operations teams, which work side by side and have complete visibility into the development process. In addition, by implementing guidelines and methods at the platform level by design, teams are aligned from the start and can work independently with the confidence that they are following the same rules.

### Why Centralize IT Governance

Governing an enterprise-wide IT platform means providing the best support to different areas of the business, with all that entails in terms of IT management, alignment of work between internal teams, external vendors and stakeholder needs. It's a task that is addressed by adopting processes and tools that facilitate centralized IT governance by the CIO and his team, while making all teams working on the platform autonomous and independent in developing and (eventually) releasing code.

Working in this way simplifies collaboration between business and IT: the business has the entire catalog of APIs at its disposal and can experiment, hackathon, partner and easily build new business models.
